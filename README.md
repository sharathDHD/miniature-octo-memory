## Technical Details

### Content Generation Algorithm

The application uses a pattern-based approach to generate new content:

1. **Analysis Phase**: 
   - Extracts vocabulary and common words from inspiration chapters
   - Identifies sentence patterns and structures
   - Analyzes thematic elements

2. **Generation Phase**:
   - Creates introductory content based on prompt keywords
   - Incorporates modified sentences from source material
   - Weaves in thematic vocabulary and concepts
   - Ensures appropriate length and structure

3. **Storage Phase**:
   - Saves generated novel to database
   - Creates first chapter with generated content
   - Marks content as "generated" for identification
